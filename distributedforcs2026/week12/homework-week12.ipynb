    "\n",
    "- ✅ **3+ parties** creating attestations\n",
    "- ✅ **Cryptographic signatures** (hash-based linking with CIDs)\n",
    "- ✅ **Chain validation** (verify all attestations match)\n",
    "- ✅ **Event correlation** (correlation_id tracking)\n",
    "- ✅ **Auditor verification** (independent party validates the chain)\n",

    "4. **Medical Records:** Doctor → Pharmacy → Insurance → Privacy Auditor\n",
