# Week 2 Student Analysis

## Student Perspective: Working Through Week 2

### Terms That May Be Confusing to Students
- **S3** - acronym not spelled out (Simple Storage Service)
- **Bucket policies** - what are these exactly?
- **Block Public Access** - why would this be enabled by default?
- **Versioning** - what does this mean for a static site?
- **REST endpoints** vs **website hosting endpoints** - significant difference not well explained
- **CloudFront** - what is a CDN? Acronym not defined
- **Distribution** - CloudFront terminology not explained
- **Cache invalidation** - concept not defined
- **Origin** - CloudFront terminology

### Instruction Issues/Confusion
1. **Bucket naming** - no guidance on naming conventions or restrictions
2. **Region selection** - no guidance on which region to choose
3. **Bucket policy snippet** - mentioned in notes but not provided in main instructions
4. **403 errors** - notes mention "many students will get 403" but no troubleshooting in main content
5. **Website endpoint vs object URL** - difference not explained clearly
6. **CloudFront setup** - marked as optional but no clear guidance on when to skip

### Missing Prerequisites
- AWS account must be set up (from Week 1 - but that wasn't completable)
- AWS CLI configured (also from Week 1)
- Understanding of HTML/CSS basics
- Basic understanding of web hosting concepts

### Work Log - Attempting S3 Static Site
**Cannot proceed** - AWS CLI not available from Week 1
**Would need:**
1. AWS account creation
2. AWS CLI installation and configuration
3. S3 bucket creation via console (since CLI unavailable)

### Additional Confusing Instructions from Lab
1. **"provided starter site files"** - where are these? No assignment repo provided
2. **"from the assignment repo /site/"** - no such repo exists for students
3. **"Update bucket policy only as needed"** - how do I know what's needed?
4. **"mind Block Public Access settings"** - what should I mind exactly?
5. **"lifecycle/budget protections"** - what are these? Not explained

### Simulated Student Experience
- Would likely use AWS Console instead of CLI
- Would encounter 403 errors as predicted in notes
- Would need to figure out bucket policies without examples
- CloudFront setup would be confusing without clear steps
- Would be stuck looking for starter files that don't exist

### Critical Missing Elements
1. **Starter site files** - referenced but not provided
2. **Bucket policy examples** - mentioned in notes but not in instructions
3. **Step-by-step console screenshots** - would help visual learners
4. **Troubleshooting section** - for common 403 errors
5. **Cost warnings** - CloudFront costs not mentioned

### Overall Week 2 Assessment
**Completion Status:** Cannot complete - missing starter files and AWS setup
**Biggest Blockers:**
1. No starter site files provided
2. AWS account/CLI still not set up from Week 1
3. No bucket policy examples
4. Vague instructions about "as needed" configurations
