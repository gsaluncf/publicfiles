AWS S3 PRODUCT OVERVIEW - For Canvas Content
================================================================================

This document provides content for explaining AWS S3 to students.
Use this to create the "What is S3?" section in Canvas HTML pages.

================================================================================
WHAT IS AWS S3?
================================================================================

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS's object storage service. Think of it
as a massive, globally distributed file system in the cloud.

Key Characteristics:
- Store any type of file (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, data, etc.)
- Access files via HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Pay only for what you use (storage + requests + data transfer)
- 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability - your files won't get lost
- Scales automatically - no capacity planning needed

================================================================================
WHY USE S3 FOR STATIC WEBSITES?
================================================================================

Traditional Web Hosting Problems:
- Need to manage servers (updates, security, scaling)
- Pay for server capacity even when site is idle
- Complex deployment processes
- Server can crash or get overloaded

S3 Static Website Hosting Advantages:
- No servers to manage - AWS handles everything
- Automatically scales to handle traffic spikes
- Pay only for actual usage (pennies per month for small sites)
- Built-in redundancy - files stored in multiple locations
- Simple deployment - just upload files
- Perfect for portfolios, documentation, landing pages

What "Static" Means:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript files served directly to browser
- No server-side code (PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.)
- JavaScript can still make sites interactive (forms, animations, API calls)
- Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) can build static sites

================================================================================
BASIC COSTS (2026 Pricing)
================================================================================

S3 Standard Storage (us-east-1):
- First 50 TB: $0.023 per GB per month
- Example: 100 MB site = $0.0023/month (~$0.03/year)

S3 Requests:
- PUT/POST: $0.005 per 1,000 requests
- GET: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests
- Example: 1,000 page views = $0.0004

Data Transfer:
- First 100 GB/month: FREE
- After that: $0.09 per GB
- Example: 1,000 page views (1 MB each) = 1 GB = FREE

Typical Student Assignment Cost:
- Storage: $0.0002/month (100 MB site)
- Requests: $0.0004 (1,000 page views)
- Data Transfer: $0 (under 100 GB)
- TOTAL: Less than $0.01 for the entire assignment

Cost Management:
- Use 99_teardown.bat to delete everything after assignment
- Set up billing alerts in AWS Console
- Free tier: 5 GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests/month

When to Use Each:
- S3: Learning AWS, need AWS integration, enterprise projects
- GitHub Pages: Free, simple, already using GitHub
- Netlify/Vercel: Modern frameworks, need CI/CD, form handling
- Azure/GCP: Already using those cloud platforms

================================================================================
WHAT "MORE" LOOKS LIKE - BEYOND BASIC S3
================================================================================

Level 1: Basic S3 (This Assignment)
- Upload files manually or via CLI
- HTTP-only access
- S3 website endpoint URL (long, ugly)
- No custom domain
- No HTTPS

Level 2: S3 + CloudFront (Optional Extra Credit)
- CloudFront = AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Caches content at edge locations worldwide
- Faster load times for global users
- HTTPS support (SSL/TLS certificates)
- Custom domain support (your-site.com)
- Cost: ~$0.085 per GB transferred (first 10 TB)

Level 3: S3 + CloudFront + Route 53 (Production)
- Route 53 = AWS's DNS service
- Manage custom domains (buy or transfer domains)
- Advanced routing (geo-location, failover)
- Health checks and monitoring
- Cost: $0.50/month per hosted zone + $0.40 per million queries

Level 4: Full Static Site Pipeline (Professional)

================================================================================
COMMON STUDENT QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Why not just use GitHub Pages for free?
A: GitHub Pages is great! But learning S3 teaches you cloud fundamentals,
   cost management, and AWS skills that apply to many other services.

Q: What if I forget to run teardown and get charged?
A: Set up billing alerts in AWS Console. For this assignment, even if you
   forget for a month, cost would be under $0.10. But always clean up!

Q: Can I use S3 for my real portfolio site?
A: Yes! Add CloudFront + Route 53 for custom domain and HTTPS. Total cost
   would be ~$1-2/month for a personal site with moderate traffic.

Q: Is S3 faster than GitHub Pages?
A: Not necessarily. GitHub Pages uses a CDN. S3 alone is not a CDN, but
   S3 + CloudFront is comparable or faster.

Q: Can I host a React/Vue/Angular app on S3?
A: Yes! Build your app to static files (npm run build), then upload the
   build folder to S3. Works perfectly.

Q: What's the difference between S3 and EC2?
A: S3 stores files. EC2 runs servers. S3 is for static content, EC2 is for
   applications that need server-side processing.
