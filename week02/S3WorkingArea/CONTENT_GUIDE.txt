WEEK 2 CONTENT GUIDE - What to Include in HTML/Canvas Pages
================================================================================

Based on tested scripts, here's what actually works and should be documented:

================================================================================
1. PREREQUISITES (What Students Need Before Starting)
================================================================================

From Week 1:
✓ AWS account created
✓ AWS CLI installed (version 2.x)
✓ AWS CLI configured with access keys (aws configure)
✓ Verified with: aws sts get-caller-identity

New for Week 2:
✓ Understanding of HTML/CSS/JS basics
✓ Text editor for customizing site files
✓ Web browser for testing

================================================================================
2. ASSIGNMENT WORKFLOW (Tested and Validated)
================================================================================

Step 1: Get Assignment Repository
- Accept GitHub Classroom assignment link
- Clone repository to local machine
- Navigate to S3WorkingArea directory

Step 2: Verify AWS CLI Setup
- Run: 00_verify_aws_cli.bat
- Confirms AWS CLI installed and credentials work
- Tests S3 access permissions

Step 3: Create S3 Bucket
- Run: 01_create_bucket.bat
- Choose globally unique bucket name (e.g., ncf-s26-yourname-site)
- Select AWS region (recommend us-east-1 for simplicity)
- Script enables static website hosting automatically

Step 4: Upload Site Files
- Run: 02_sync_site.bat
- Uses command: aws s3 sync .\site s3://bucket-name --delete
- Uploads: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- --delete flag removes files not in local directory

Step 5: Configure Public Access
- Run: 03_set_bucket_policy.bat
- Disables Block Public Access (required for public websites)
- Applies bucket policy for public read access
- Policy allows s3:GetObject for all objects

Step 6: Verify Website
- Run: 04_verify_website.bat
- Displays website URL: http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com
- Tests HTTP connectivity
- Opens site in browser

Step 7: Customize Site (Optional)
- Edit files in site/ directory
- Use LLM assistant to enhance (see Enhancement Zone in index.html)
- Re-run 02_sync_site.bat to upload changes

Step 8: Submit Assignment
- Copy website URL
- Submit to Canvas
- Take screenshot of live site

Step 9: Teardown (CRITICAL)
- Run: 99_teardown.bat
- Deletes all objects in bucket
- Deletes bucket itself
- Prevents ongoing AWS charges

================================================================================
3. KEY COMMANDS STUDENTS WILL USE
================================================================================

aws s3 sync .\site s3://bucket-name --delete
  - Syncs local directory to S3 bucket
  - --delete removes files not in source
  - Preserves file structure

aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/
  - Lists objects in bucket
  - Verifies upload succeeded

aws s3api get-bucket-website --bucket bucket-name
  - Shows website configuration
  - Confirms static hosting enabled

aws s3 rm s3://bucket-name --recursive
  - Deletes all objects in bucket
  - Required before deleting bucket

aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket bucket-name
  - Deletes empty bucket
  - Fails if bucket not empty

================================================================================
4. COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS (From Testing)
================================================================================

Issue: "Bucket name already exists"
Solution: Bucket names are globally unique. Choose different name.

Issue: "403 Forbidden" when accessing website
Solution: 
  - Run 03_set_bucket_policy.bat
  - Verify Block Public Access is disabled
  - Check bucket policy is applied

Issue: "SignatureDoesNotMatch" error
Solution: AWS credentials invalid. Run: aws configure

Issue: "Unable to locate credentials"
Solution: AWS CLI not configured. Run: aws configure

Issue: Cannot delete bucket
Solution: 
  - Bucket must be empty first
  - Run: aws s3 rm s3://bucket-name --recursive
  - Then: aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket bucket-name

================================================================================
5. CLOUDFRONT (Optional Extra Credit)
================================================================================

What is CloudFront?
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Caches content at edge locations worldwide
- Provides HTTPS support
- Enables custom domain names
- Improves global performance

When to use CloudFront:
- Want HTTPS (S3 website endpoints are HTTP only)
- Want custom domain (e.g., mysite.com instead of S3 URL)
- Need better global performance
- Want to use Route 53 for DNS

How it works with S3:
- S3 bucket is the "origin"
- CloudFront distribution sits in front
- Requests go to CloudFront, which fetches from S3
- Content is cached at edge locations

Cost considerations:
- CloudFront has free tier (1 TB data transfer/month)
- Minimal cost for class assignment
- Must invalidate cache when updating files (costs $0.005 per path)

Custom Domain + CloudFront:
- If student did Week 1 extra credit (custom domain)
- Can point domain to CloudFront distribution
- Requires Route 53 or external DNS provider
- CloudFront can provision SSL certificate (free via ACM)

Note: CloudFront scripts not included yet - may add later

================================================================================
6. COST BREAKDOWN (Actual AWS Pricing)
================================================================================

S3 Storage: $0.023 per GB/month
  - Starter site is ~10 KB
  - Cost: ~$0.0002/month

S3 Requests: $0.0004 per 1,000 GET requests
  - 100 page views = $0.00004

Data Transfer: First 100 GB/month free
  - Starter site is 10 KB per load
  - 10,000 loads = 100 MB = FREE

Total for assignment: < $0.01 if cleaned up within a week

================================================================================
7. GITHUB CLASSROOM SETUP
================================================================================

Repository structure:
S3WorkingArea/
  ├── site/              # Students customize these files
  ├── *.bat              # Helper scripts (read-only)
  └── README.md          # Instructions

Students will:
1. Accept assignment link
2. Get personal copy of repository
3. Clone to local machine
4. Customize site files
5. Deploy to S3
6. Submit URL

Template repository should include:
- All scripts (tested and working)
- Starter site files
- README with instructions
- .gitignore for bucket_*.txt files

================================================================================
8. LEARNING OBJECTIVES (What Students Actually Learn)
================================================================================

✓ AWS S3 bucket creation and configuration
✓ Static website hosting concepts
✓ AWS CLI commands for S3 operations
✓ Bucket policies and IAM permissions
✓ Public vs private access controls
✓ Website endpoints vs REST endpoints
✓ Cost management and resource cleanup
✓ Using LLM assistants for code enhancement
