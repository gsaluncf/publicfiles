================================================================================
STEP 3: DISTRIBUTE ASSIGNMENT LINK

- Share this link with students via Canvas

Students will:
1. Click invitation link
2. Accept assignment
3. GitHub creates personal repository: week02-s3-static-site-{username}
4. Clone repository to local machine
5. Complete assignment
6. Push customizations back to GitHub (optional)
7. Deploy to S3 and submit URL to Canvas

================================================================================

================================================================================
STEP 6: MONITORING STUDENT PROGRESS
================================================================================

GitHub Classroom Dashboard shows:
- Who has accepted assignment
- Last commit timestamp
- Repository activity

Canvas shows:
- Who has submitted URL
- Submission timestamps

Instructor can:
- View all student repositories
- Leave feedback via Pull Requests
- Check commit history
- Clone and test locally

================================================================================
STEP 7: COMMON STUDENT ISSUES
================================================================================

Issue: "Can't clone repository"
Solution: Check Git is installed, SSH keys configured

Issue: "Scripts don't run"
Solution: Must use Command Prompt (cmd.exe), not PowerShell

Issue: "AWS CLI not found"
Solution: Install AWS CLI, restart terminal

Issue: "Bucket name already exists"
Solution: Choose different name (globally unique)

Issue: "403 Forbidden"
Solution: Run 03_set_bucket_policy.bat

Issue: "Can't delete bucket"
Solution: Run 99_teardown.bat or manually empty bucket first

================================================================================
STEP 8: AFTER ASSIGNMENT DEADLINE
================================================================================

1. Grade submissions in Canvas
2. Verify URLs are accessible
3. Check for customization
4. Leave feedback in GitHub Classroom
5. Remind students to run 99_teardown.bat to avoid charges

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: MANUAL DISTRIBUTION (Without GitHub Classroom)
================================================================================

If GitHub Classroom doesn't work:

1. Create public repository with template
2. Share repository URL with students
3. Students fork or download ZIP
4. Complete assignment locally
5. Deploy to S3
6. Submit URL to Canvas

Pros: Simpler, no GitHub Classroom account needed
Cons: No automatic repository creation, harder to track progress
