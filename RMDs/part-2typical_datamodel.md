Session 2 should focus on the wealth management data model.
Explain the idea of a "typical" data model for wealth management. Include the basics of what makes things hard.


Temporal aspects (purchase dates, current values changing)
One-to-many relationships (client has many lots)
Lookup tables vs. transactional tables
Why normalize tax lot types?

Data model challenges:

How do we handle "current market value" when markets move daily?
What if we need historical prices, not just today's?
How do we model "age of lot" for tax rules?
