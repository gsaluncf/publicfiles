<h1>Session 1: The Problem</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #475569;">Understanding wealth management data through a real tax optimization problem</p>

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">What Is Wealth Management?</h2>

<p>Wealth management is a service business. Clients pay advisors to help them make financial decisions: how to invest, when to sell, how to minimize taxes, how to plan for retirement, how to pass money to their kids.</p>

<p>Behind every recommendation is data. Lots of it:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Holdings data:</strong> What does the client own? Stocks, bonds, real estate, cash.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax lot data:</strong> When did they buy each asset? At what price? This determines taxes when they sell.</li>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Is the money in a 401(k)? An IRA? A regular brokerage account? Each has different tax rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Market data:</strong> What are current prices? What are expected returns?</li>
    <li><strong>Client data:</strong> How old are they? What is their risk tolerance? When do they need the money?</li>
</ul>

<p>This seminar uses a specific wealth management problem to teach you how this data works. You will not become a financial advisor. But you will understand how to model financial data and make decisions under uncertainty.</p>

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">The Three Types of Investment Accounts</h2>

<p>In the United States, there are three main types of accounts where people hold investments. Each has different tax treatment:</p>

<p>Most retirees have money in multiple account types. The question is: which account should they take money from first?</p>

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">What Is a Tax Lot?</h2>

<p>When you buy shares of a stock, you create a "tax lot." A tax lot records:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What you bought (e.g., 100 shares of Apple)</li>
    <li>When you bought it (e.g., March 15, 2020)</li>
    <li>What you paid (e.g., $250 per share, so $25,000 total)</li>
</ul>

<p>The price you paid is called your <strong>cost basis</strong>. When you sell, you pay taxes on the difference between the sale price and your cost basis. This difference is your <strong>capital gain</strong>.</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8fafc; border: 1px solid #cbd5e1; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> You bought 100 shares of Apple at $250 (cost basis = $25,000). Today Apple is $400 per share (value = $40,000). If you sell, your capital gain is $15,000. You owe taxes on that $15,000.</p>
<p>But if you never sell, you never owe taxes. The gain is "unrealized" - it exists on paper but you have not locked it in.</p>
</div>

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">Two Tax Rules That Create Our Problem</h2>

<p>The U.S. tax code has two rules that pull in opposite directions. Understanding these rules is the key to understanding our problem.</p>

<h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-top: 25px;">Rule 1: Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</h3>

<p>The government gave you a tax break when you put money into your Traditional IRA or 401(k). But they want their taxes eventually. So starting at age 73, the IRS <em>forces</em> you to withdraw money from these accounts every year.</p>

<p>The amount you must withdraw is based on your account balance and your age. At 73, you must withdraw about 3.8% of your balance. At 80, about 5%. At 90, about 8.8%. The percentage increases as you age because the IRS assumes you have fewer years left.</p>

<p>Every dollar you withdraw is taxed as ordinary income. If you are in the 24% tax bracket, you lose 24 cents of every dollar to taxes.</p>

<p><strong>The IRS is saying:</strong> "We let you defer taxes for decades. Now pay up."</p>

<h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-top: 25px;">Rule 2: Step-Up in Basis</h3>

<p>When you die, something remarkable happens to your taxable brokerage account. Your heirs inherit your assets at their <em>current market value</em>, not at your original cost basis.</p>

<p>Remember that Apple stock you bought at $250 that is now worth $400? If you sell it, you owe taxes on the $150 gain. But if you die holding it, your daughter inherits it with a cost basis of $400. If she sells it immediately for $400, her gain is zero. She owes nothing.</p>

<p>All those years of appreciation? The IRS forgives them. The unrealized gains disappear.</p>

<p><strong>The IRS is saying:</strong> "If you hold until death, we will pretend the gains never happened."</p>

<div style="background-color: #fef3c7; border: 1px solid #f59e0b; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
<h3 style="color: #92400e; margin-top: 5px;">The Conflict</h3>
<p>These two rules create a tension:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RMDs force you to take money out</strong> of tax-deferred accounts and pay taxes now.</li>
    <li><strong>Step-up rewards you for holding</strong> appreciated assets in taxable accounts until death.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you knew exactly when you would die and exactly what the market would do, you could calculate the optimal strategy. But you do not know either of those things.</p>
</div>

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">Meet Robert: A Concrete Example</h2>

<p>Robert is 65 years old. He just retired. He has:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>$1,000,000 in a Traditional IRA.</strong> He contributed over 30 years of working. He got tax deductions on every contribution. He has never paid taxes on any of this money.</li>
    <li><strong>$500,000 in a taxable brokerage account.</strong> He invested $200,000 over the years. It has grown to $500,000. He has $300,000 in unrealized gains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Robert needs $60,000 per year to live on. He has two children he wants to leave money to.</p>

<p>Robert has a choice:</p>

<h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-top: 25px;">Strategy A: Spend Down the IRA First</h3>

<p>Robert takes $60,000 per year from his IRA. He pays income tax on every withdrawal (let's say 22%, so $13,200 per year in taxes). His taxable brokerage account continues to grow untouched.</p>

<p>When Robert dies, his children inherit the brokerage account with a stepped-up basis. They owe no taxes on the $300,000+ in gains.</p>

<h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-top: 25px;">Strategy B: Spend the Taxable Account First</h3>

<p>Robert takes $60,000 per year from his taxable brokerage account. He pays capital gains tax on the gains portion (let's say 15%, so less than the income tax rate). His IRA continues to grow untouched.</p>

<p>But at age 73, RMDs kick in. Robert is forced to withdraw from his IRA whether he needs the money or not. And his IRA has been growing for 8 more years, so the RMDs are larger. He pays income tax on all of it.</p>

<h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-top: 25px;">Which Strategy Wins?</h3>

<p>It depends on two things Robert cannot control:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>How long Robert lives.</strong> If he dies at 70, he never faces RMDs. Strategy B wins because his children get the step-up on the brokerage account AND inherit the IRA (which they can stretch over 10 years). If he lives to 95, he faces 22 years of RMDs that drain his IRA anyway.</li>
    <li><strong>What the market does.</strong> If the market crashes, his unrealized gains shrink and the step-up is worth less. If the market booms, his IRA grows larger and RMDs become more painful.</li>
</ol>

<div style="background-color: #dbeafe; border: 1px solid #93c5fd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
<h3 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 5px;">This Is Our Problem</h3>
<p>We cannot calculate the answer because we do not know the inputs. We need to simulate thousands of possible futures - different lifespans, different market returns - and see which strategy wins more often, and by how much.</p>
<p>This is what you will build in this seminar.</p>
</div>

<hr style="border: 1px solid #cbd5e1; margin: 30px 0;">

<h2 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 30px;">What You Will Build</h2>

<p>Over the next 1.5 days, you will build a simulation that answers Robert's question. The simulation will:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Generate 10,000 possible market futures</strong> using a model called Geometric Brownian Motion (we will explain this)</li>
    <li><strong>Generate 10,000 possible lifespans</strong> using real actuarial data from the Social Security Administration</li>
    <li><strong>Apply the tax rules</strong> to each combination of market path and lifespan</li>
    <li><strong>Store the results</strong> in a database so you can query them</li>
    <li><strong>Find the answer:</strong> Under what conditions does Strategy A beat Strategy B? By how much? How confident can we be?</li>
</ol>

<p>You will use Python for the simulation and DuckDB for the database. By the end, you will have a working system that can answer questions like: "If Robert has a 60% chance of living past 85, which strategy maximizes expected wealth for his children?"</p>
