# INTERNAL INSTRUCTOR NOTES - NOT FOR STUDENTS

## Seminar Title: Data Science in Wealth Management
## Working Title: Stochastic Tax-Optimization & Portfolio Simulation

**NOTE:** This document contains the instructor's conceptual framework and technical overview. Students should start with `index.html` for student-facing materials.

This 1.5-day seminar focuses on the intersection of distributed systems, database management, and probabilistic modeling within the context of wealth management. Students will build a simulation engine to quantify "Tax Alpha"—the value generated by optimizing financial decisions around Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and the "Step-up in Basis" tax rule.
Seminar Overview
The project tasks students with solving a multi-variable optimization problem: How do we maximize multi-generational wealth when market returns and human lifespans are uncertain? Students will interact with a database of "tax lots" (individual records of asset purchases) and run large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to model the trade-off between the tax penalties of RMDs and the tax benefits of holding appreciated assets until inheritance.
Learning Objectives
 * Probabilistic Modeling: Implement Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to simulate market volatility and apply Survival Analysis using actuarial life tables to model mortality as a probability distribution.
 * Database Architecture for Analytics: Design and query a "Tax Lot" schema that tracks cost basis, purchase dates, and unrealized gains across thousands of simulated scenarios.
 * Monte Carlo Methods: Execute and aggregate 10^4+ simulation paths to derive statistical metrics such as Expected Value, Value at Risk (VaR), and Confidence Intervals for different financial strategies.
 * Decision Science: Quantify the "Tax Alpha" of a "Hold-to-Death" strategy (leveraging the Step-up in Basis) versus an "Aggressive Decumulation" strategy (managing RMDs).
Technical Workflow
| Phase | Task | Data Science / Technical Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Modeling | Generate 10,000 market & lifespan paths | Stochastic Processes & Survival Analysis |
| Processing | Apply RMD and Step-up logic to "Tax Lot" DB | SQL / Logic Layer Integration |
| Analysis | Aggregate results to find the "Optimal Strategy" | Statistical Inference & Distribution Analysis |
| Visualization | Map the Tax-Efficient Frontier | Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly) |
The Core Challenge
The students' primary goal is to determine the point of indifference: at what level of market volatility or life expectancy does it become more mathematically sound to pay the RMD taxes early versus holding for the Step-up in Basis? This moves the seminar beyond basic programming and into the realm of predictive financial engineering.
